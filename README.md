# Multistep form with validation and progress bar

This is a multistep form with reactive input validation and progress bar.
The project is written in React and TypeScript. It uses [redux](https://redux.js.org/) with [redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for state management and a custom `redux-toolkit` solution for managing the form state. [Wouter](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter) is used for creating a routable stepper.

Styling is done with [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animations.

Project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for development and bundling.
